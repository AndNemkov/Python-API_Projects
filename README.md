# Python-API_Projects
General Description: 

    This repositary provides several past projects completed with Python and API usage tools. Coding is done fully with Python and API usage is intertwined to allow for 
    more diverse code implmentation.

Projects Status: 

    All three project files are completed and are no longer in development. Necessary measures will be taken to improve the code if isuses occur in the future.

Requirements: 

    All three project files can be run by any software type that allows for Python coding.
    If there are issues running the nltk.corpus module, use the following python code to fix the problem:
        import nltk
        nltk.download('words')
        from nltk.corpus import words
    If further issues arise, look into the nltk documentation page in this link: https://www.nltk.org/data.html
